# Thinking about big data

[Course here!](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-driven-astronomy/home/week/1)

### Course overview

As astronomy became a science we were able to start asking quantitative questions and making high precision measurements.

Modern astronomers are trying to answer these, using some of the world's most incredible scientific instruments. 
But these instruments generate huge amounts of data up to petabytes per night.

Every individual scientist nowadays has to deal with *medium sized* data.

The course is aimed at
- astronomers who want to learn more about **computational** approaches
- programmers who want to learn modern astronomy
- students who want to improve their data analysis or coding skills
