### First ideas
In 1930, Astronomers V. Badda and F. Zwicky were searching for an explanation for supernova.

They suggested that when an old large star runs out of nuclear fuel, it rapidly collapses under its own gravity. The star's core suddenly transforms into a super dense ball of neutrons, and the outer layers of the star bounce off in a massive explosion of light and energy, a supernova. 
The dense core of neutrons that remains behind, dubs a neutron star, would have the mass of two or three suns squeezed down into the size of a large city.

### 2 things that happen w a star collapses
In the 1960s, astronomers realized that when a star collapses, 2 interesting things can happen.

1. Stars typically rotate perhaps one every few days. The law of _conservation of angular momentum_ says, that when a star collapses the rotation speeds up. So, a neutron star could be spinning anything from once a seconf to tens or even hundreds of times a second.
2. Also, like the Earth, stars have magnetic fields. And when a star collapses, it takes the fields with it. So, neutron stars would have incredibly intense magnetic fields. Charged particles in the super-hot plasma surrounding a neutron star, would get funneled towards the stars magnetic poles and shot out into the space as two intense beams.

Thus, a neutron star becomes a bit like a lighthouse, rapidly spinning in space, flashing its energy beams across the universe. 
And suddenly the signal that Bell and Hewish found with their radio telescope made sense.

The regular pulses they saw were the beams of a spinning neutron star sweeping part the Earth every 1.3s. When they and other astronomers looked around the sky, they found more spinning neutron stars. Some of it slower, some much faster. They called them Pulsars.

### Observations of Pulsars

#### The first Pulsar
The first pulsar was discovered by chance by Jocelyn Bell and Anthony Hewish in 1967. She observed a very faint blip coming from one part of the sky that repeated every 1.3s with incredible precision. The LGM-1 for Little Green Men.
The pulsar discovered by Bell and Hewish is now called PSR B1919+21:

- PSR: Pulsating Source of Radio
- B1919+21: position of the pulsar in the sky

They have now been observed using optical, X-ray and gamma-ray telescopes.

#### How to "observe" pulsars

- Astronomer positions the radio telescope at an area of sky for a few minutes to 12h: longer for weaker pulsars
- Output is continuously recorded by a computer with plenty of storage space
- The data is then searched for periodic signals (like the one found by Jocelyn Bell) which, if found, confirm the presence of a pulsar.

If plugged into a suitable loud-speaker(instead of recoding the data on to a computer system) then you would [hear the signal](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/outreach//education/everyone/pulsars/B0329.mp3).

```ad-definition
title: Period
The time inverval between consecutive pulses. The time between pulses is incredibly regular and can be measured very precisely.
```

Periods of 1s are typical although pulsars have been discovered with periods of 1ms (=0,001s) up to 8s.

However the periods of all radio pulsars are increasing extremely slowly.

```ad-definition

- _Ordinary_ pulsars
- _Milisecond_ pulsars: those with periods of a few ms and whose periods are changing very slowly.
```

This plot displays pulses from the pulsar PSR B0329+54. The pulses can look very different from each other in both shape and height as seen in the plot.
```

#### What do pulsar observations tell us?
- (Finding) Each pulse is made up of radio waves of different frequencies. White light is made up of all the colours of the spectrum.
- (Observed) Highest frequencies of a pulse arrive at a telescope slightly before the lower frequencies: 

```ad-definition
title: Phenomena: Pulse dispersion
The reason for this is that the pulse has been travelling through the [[Week 1#^2f9814|interstellar medium]] and the different frequencies making up the pulse travel at different speeds through this medium.
```

```ad-definition
title: Interstellar medium
The space between an object in space and the Earth
```

^2f9814

The more distant pulsars are dispersed more than the closer ones and so time delays between the different frequencies can be used to estimate an approximate distance to a pulsar.

#### Where can you find pulsars?
Except for a few in the Magellanic Clouds, **most** pulsars are found to be well **outside of our solar system but within our Galaxy**. 
The youngest pulsars (keep in mind are many thousands of years old) are found to lie withing the plane of the Milky Way.


##### Supernova remnants

- The very **youngest** are found within **supernova remants**: suggesting that they were probably "born" during the explosion of a massive star.

These young pulsars are found to be travelling through space very fast. As they age they move away fron the plane of the Galaxy.

- The fastest will never come back - escaping from the Galaxy and traveling off into the space between galaxies becoming undetectable
- The rest will slowdown and then drop back towards the plane. They will continue to oscillate up and down for the rest of their lives.

##### Binary systems
Similarly to most stars in our Galaxy, many pulsars (in particular he **ms pulsars**) are found in binary systems (pairs of stars or other objects in orbit with another).

Found companions to pulsars: 
- normal stars
- planets
- white dwarf stars
- neutron stars
- even, recently discovered, another pulsar

```ad-note
icon: key
Studying the pulsar's **motion** in a binary system allows astronomers to determine facts about the pulsar, its companion and the orbit.
```

Sometimes the mass can be determined and is found to be roughly 1.5x as massive as our Sun. 
We also know that pulsars are very small so they must be very dense. In fact, 1tsp of pulsar material would weigh a $10^9$ tonnes if we brought it to the surface of the Earth.

##### Conslusions of Pulsar Observations
Observations of pulsars tell us that they are:
- are far away
- are very small
- are very dense
- can orbit other objects
- were probably born in supernova explosions
- are  travelling very fast through space
- the time btwn pulses is extremely regular although they are slowing down very slightly

Let's try to put together the idea of what a pulsar is.


### Theory of Pulsars
![Cr. Michael Kramer (University of Manchester) Animation of a pulsar](lightsmall-optimised.gif)

1934: Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky predicted the existence of neutron stars: 

```ad-definition
title: Neutron Stars
Stars which have collapsed under their own gravity during a supernova explosion
```

```ad-warning
title: N B
Only very massive stars (at least a few times more massive than our Sun) will undergo a supernova explosion and become neutron stars. 

- Stars like our Sun will not form neutron stars
- Even more massive stars will collapse to form black holes
```

#### Pulsar Model
Neutron stars were predicted to be:
- undetectable by telescopes on Earth
- very dense
- to spin very fast
- have a tiny radius of only ~10km 
- to possess large magnetic fields

We now know that charged particles moving along the magnetic field could cause beams of raditation to be emitted from the magnetic poles. Then, as the neutron star rotates, the beam would sweep across space.
When this beam is in the direction of the Earth, a pulse may be detectable using a radio telescope.

#### Theory vs. Observations

![Image Credit: Imagine the Universe! at NASA/GSFC](pulsar2.gif)

We find many similarities between the observations of pulsars in the 1st section and the description of neutron stars.

- the pulses that occur at regular intervals correspond to a beam being emitted from a rotating neutron star
- the time between pulses, the _period_,  is the time that it takes for the neutron star to rotate once
- the increase in the period is due to the pulsar slowing down slightly as it loses energy
- youngest pulsars are found in supernova remnants which is exactly the place we'd expect neutron stars to be born

Therefore, the most likely explanation is that


```ad-definition
title: Pulsar
A **pulsar** is a neutron star that spins rapidly and emits radio waves along its magnetic axis.
```

```ad-warning
title: NB
Not all neutron stars are necessarily detectable as pulsars:
- the beams from some of them may never pass the Earth
- some neutron stars may have been pulsars in the past, but the process that causes the beam of radiation (**which is not fully understood**) may have turned off or is just too weak to be detected.
```

##### Types of pulsars

An explanation for ms pulsars.

```ad-tip
color: 212, 155, 84
icon: lightbulb
title: ms pulsars
Assuming that all ms pulsars were originally in orbit with another star; after the pulsar formed, matter was pulled from the companion star on to the pulsar. During this process the pulsar rotated faster and faster until it became one of the ms pulsars.
```

Later, the companion star died and became either a white dwarf, neutron star or black hole depending on its original size.
If the companion star remained in orbit with the pulsar, a binary ms pulsar system would be formed.

#### How does a pulsar age?
Nobody is quite sure of how a pulsar ages and slows down.
 It is likely that after a few million years the beam of radiation switches off. This may be because the pulsar's magnetic field decays away or that the beam just gets weaker and weaker until it is undetectable. Such problems may be solved by studying pulsars discovered in recent surveys.

### Current Research

#### The Parkes multibeam pulsar surveys

January 1997: a 13-beam receiver was installed on the Parkes radio telescope: the _multibeam receiver_.

- Initially built to search for galaxies, really helped to search for pulsars: more than 700 in the plane of our Galaxy
- It allows to observe 13 areas of the sky simultaneously
- Astronomers can afford to spend much longer on any particular area of the sky than was possible in the past
- Thus allowing to detect weaker pulsar signals than before
- A few new discoveries: young pulsars, distant pulsars, pulsars in binary systems & even more ms pulsars

Other pulsar surveys with this receiver include the _high latitude survey_ to search for ms pulsars. It did not discover as many pulsars, but what is probably the most exciting pulsar system known.

#### The double pulsar system
A pulsar in orbit with another pulsar has been discovered by astronomers using the Parkes radio telescope. Ms pulsars allow for testing theories of gravity with great accuracy. This finding will let scientists perform even better tests.

#### Timing array projects
Ms pulsars are regularly observed for many purposes:
- to investigate atomic clocks on Earth,
- improve understanding of masses and motions of the planets in our solar system
- (with luck) to detect gravity waves

```ad-definition
title: Gravity Waves
Ripples of space and time. They come from very extreme regions of spacetime such as the very early Universe and the cores of galaxies.
```

Therefore, we can improve clocks on Earth and, at the same time, study the very early Universe and colliding supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies!

#### The interior structure of neutron stars
Neutron stars are

- very small (like the size of a city)
- very far away

yet astronomers can work out what is going on beneath their surfaces?

```ad-tip
color: 212, 155, 84
icon: lightbulb
title: idea
Neutron stars are very small and very far away, yet astronomers can figure out what is going on beneath their surfaces? How?
**By looking for small changes in the rotation of the pulsar.**
```

Sometimes, a pulsar can "glitch".

```ad-definition
title: glitching
Although pulsars slow down as they age, a few of them **suddenly start spinning faster**(in a very short space of time) and then slowly return to their original spin rate.
```

For example, the Crab pulsar in the Crab nebula has been observed to do this many times.
The causes of glitching are not clear yet, but current explanations suggest that glitches are probably due to the way the interior superfluid of a neutron star interacts with its crystalline surface.

![Internal structure of a neutron star](nstar3.jpg)
```ad-note
title: The interior structure of a neutron star
It consists of iron, neutron rich nuclei and electrons in the outer crust.
The inner crust contains neutron rich nuclei, free superfluid neutrons and electrons and the interior, superfluid neutrons, superfluid protons and electrons.
And still, the core is unknown.
```

#### The SKA (Square Kilometre Array)

The SKA will be one of the next generation radio telescopes. 
Greater sensitivities than any current radio telescope because its large total collecting area will be 1km^2 (made up of many antennas).
**Fainter pulsars will be detectable.** More pulsars and distant galaxies will be found as well, though.

Astronomers' hope is: to discover a pulsar orbiting a black hole. It would allow more general relativity tests to be done and alternative theories of gravity to be investigated.
