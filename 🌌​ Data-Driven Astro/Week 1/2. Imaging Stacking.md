### The question

```ad-success
icon: question
_How many pulsars are detected in images taken with the Murchison Widefield Array Telescope (MWAT)?_
```

```ad-definition
title: The MWA
A low-frequency radio telescope in Western Australia.
- It detects radio emission at frequencies btwn 80 and 300 MHz, similar to popular radio stations
- It has a very large field of view, which means it's great for doing **large survey projects**
```

A typical image from the MWA looks like this:

![MWA](mwa.png)

The *grayscale* is a measure of the **flux density of emission from astronomical objects**. 
Black is high flix density and gray is the bg noise. 

```ad-info
title: observation
Most black dots in an image like this are **distant radio galaxies**. But some are objects in our own galaxy, such as pulsars or supernova remnants.
```

### Flux Density

In radio astronomy, flux density is measured in units of _Janskys_, which is equivalent to $10^{-26}$ watts per square meter per Hertz.

$$
1 Jy = 10^{-26} \frac{W}{m^2 \cdot Hz}
$$

In other words, flux density is a measure of _the spectral power received by a telescope detector of unit projected area._
For this exercise, we're just interested in **measuring the apparent brightness of a pulsar at a given frequency**.

```ad-note
Astronomical objects are extremely faint in comparisson to terrestrial sources such as mobile phones
```

### The files

Astronomy images are usually stored in a file format called FITS (Flexible Image Transport System). You can view them with a software called DS9 or an online tool like Aladin.

```ad-note
Some people like to color their images, but remember, radio frequencies don't have color.
```

These are little cutouts:

![Detection Images](pulsardetection.PNG)

The image on the left has a detection of a pulsar at the center and the image on the right has no detection.

```ad-definition
title: Detection
We **typically** call something a detection if the flux density is more than 5 std. higher than the noise in the local region.
```

So when looking for radio emission at MWA frequencies at the location of all known pulsars, sometimes we find detections but most of the time we don't.

When we don't, it could be for a whole range of reasons...
- the pulsar is too far away
- the intrinsic emission isn't strong at these frequencies
- the emission is intermittent and switched off

## Stacking: Info from...non-detections?
There *are* ways to derive some stuff from non-detections. One of them is **stacking**.

Let's take a signal that looks like a single Gaussian 
![Gaussian Signal](clean_gaussian.PNG)

and add some random noise. If we add enough noise, we can no longer see the signal

![Plus noise](gaussian_with_noise.PNG)

Now say we have 100 of these signals, each with random noise added.

![A 100 signals](100signals.PNG)

If we take the mean of these, 
![The mean](mean.PNG)

we can see the signal to noise ratio has increased and we can detect the underlying signal over the whole population of 100 sources!

### How to apply this?

We want to apply this to our pulsar detection problem, but there's a catch: the **undetected pulsars are located all over the sky**. And so to stack them we first need to shift their positions so they're centered on the same pixel.

Our stacking process looks sth like this:

```ad-definition
title: Image stacking process
1. Find images containing positions of known pulsars
2. Crop and shift each pulsar to the centre of each image
3. Find the mean brightness at each pixel
4. Create new image
```

### A little suggestion
You _should_ do a **median** stack. Because the median is a more robust statistic than the mean, i.e. the mean is much more sensitive to outliers than the median. If we have an assymetric distribution or there're significant outliers, the median can be a much better indicator of the central value.

Let's investigate how a seemingly simple change to our method can have a significant impact on the ease of computing the results.
