# The solution: improving your method

The story so far is that we're *trying to determine the statistical properties of pulsars that are below our detection threshold*.
We implemented a main stacking algorithm which worked ok. But we also wanted to try and implement median stacking so the statistics were more robust to outliers.

- Money
- Reframing the problem
- Developing a smarter solution

But the latter needs a loot of memory usage.
There are a whole range of different solutions. Super computers are not very feasible, so let's not go down that path.

### Reducing images
Do we really need $200$x$200$ pixels in an image? Those numbers are usually chosen arbitrarily. If, for example, we cut down our images to $50$x$50$ pixels we'd reduce our data size by a factor of $16$! Which means we would only need 12GB of memory!! 

This is a good solution if there are no important information in the outer parts of the images.

### To improve the algorithm
Currently the problem is that calculating the median requires us to store all the data in memory. Can we calculate a running median that doesn't need all of the data to be loaded in memory at the same time?

The **binapprox** algorithm.

```ad-definition
title: the Binapprox algorithm
1. Load image
2. Bin each pixel value into a histogram at that pixel
3. Generate histogram of pixel values at each pixel coordinate
4. Sum counts in each histogram, starting from lowest bin
5. When sum exceeds half the number of pixel values, stop
6. Approximate median as central value of final bin added to sum
```

As each image comes in, take the value of each pixel in the image and bin it. 
One all of the images have been processed, you end up with a histogram of counts for each pixel in the image.

Because the bins in the histogram are ordered, you can sum up the counts in the histogram starting from the smallest bin until you get to half the total number of numbers.

You then use the value of the resulting bin as your median.

### What happens when we do this stacking?
![Median stacking results](benneprox.PNG)

A clear detection is showing in the center of the image!!

But wait a second...what are we seeing here?

We took a large set of images for which we could not detect any individual pulsars. 

When we lined the images up so all of the undetected pulsars are located in the center of image, and 
then calculate the median across all of the images, we can see a detection.

```ad-note
What you're seeing here is a statistical detection of a population of pulsars that are too faint to see in our original data set.
```

We've used a really simple technique to probe a but of the invisible universe tat you couldn't otherwise see with this telescope!
